- title: Tough Little Beauties
  details: >
    "The title of radical ecologist Stephanie Mills’ collection of essays refers to the lavender irises that flourish along the coastlines of the US and Canada’s northern lakes Huron and Michigan. The tiny flowers are a threatened species against the growing onslaught of chemical pollution and fluctuating clime – and yet they are so hardy, year after year enduring icy blasts of Arctic air, stinging sands, and thunderous tumbles of snow. Digging deeper, the tough little beauties that lie before us are the essays themselves. Each is an ephemeral yet forceful burst of revelation; together, they gather into a bouquet of original thought."

  details: >
    Longtime bioregionalist Mills once again confronts, with honesty, literary sensibility and wit, the joy, struggle and chagrin of living closer to the land &ndash; and her ideals. Under the aegis of the philosopher Epicurus, using personal stories as her vehicle, Mills reflects on the seasons, more-than-human nature, conviviality, vocation, and our common fate.

- title: In Service of the Wild
  details: >
    "This is a combination travel guide to places where ecological restoration is particularly inspiring or effective, a memoir of learning more about restoring one’s home place, and a study of how, why, where and when ecological restoration works. Mills visits Aldo Leopolds’s Wisconsin shack, the salmon restoration project in the Northwest, a Utopian restoration community in southern India, and other locales to write &ndash; in eloquent, lingering and clear prose &ndash; of what she witnesses. She also writes in great depth into the questions of what it means to be wild, virgin, undisturbed. This is an important book for anyone doing anything related to restoration."

- title: Whatever Happened to Ecology?
  details: >
    "This political and social change memoir is both a story of living, writing and working with an ecological focus, and a critique of societal diminishment of the ecological movement. Written in 1988, this book obviously came out of a time when global warming, the end of peak oil, and the disappearance of honey bees weren’t common knowledge, yet Mills clearly outlines the devastation already unfolding and the need to reclaim our vigilance. This book is also a love story about place and community, and returning to one’s roots."

- title: In Praise of Nature
  details: >
    "This unusual annotated bibliography is divided into the sections of Earth, Air, Fire, Water and Spirit, and it includes annotations on a great many ecological sources plus small essays on important thinkers, activists, artists and scholars over the years (such as West Jackson, Rachel Carson, John Muir and others). It’s a treasure trove of great sources, and its only limitation is that many good books have come out since this annotated bibliography was released. All in all, this is a fascinating read that can easily expose you to many important sources in a short but illuminating time."
