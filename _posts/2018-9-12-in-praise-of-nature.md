An introduction to environmental concern, *In Praise of Nature* comprises five thought-provoking essays (“Earth,” “Air,” “Fire,” “Water,” and “Spirit”) by Stephanie Mills, each followed by a dozen or more reviews, written by notable authors, of essential books on that theme with generous excerpts from the books. *In Praise of Nature* also includes an annotated bibliography listing over 100 titles. In his Foreword Tom Brokaw wrote, “In these essays you will find the essence of nature as best as it can be captured on the printed page. The essays will lift your vision and fill your soul with awe. They will remind you that we are here to be nurtured by the environment, not to consume it. We reflect in its glory. It should not be shamed by our indifference and ignorance.”
